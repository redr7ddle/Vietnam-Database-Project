					<p style="font-size:26px;">This project is a database search and display function that takes information on bombing operations from the United States Airforce. There is a search feature that can be used to display some data based off certain attributes. There is also a map feature to display where the bombing operations occured.</p>
					<p style="font-size:26px;">The Vietnam war was started after the Gulf of Tonkin incident where the USS Maddox was allegedly attacked. This was later shown that the incident may have been false and was used as justification for the US to enter Vietnam to prevent the spread of Communism in a method of containment. This lead to the longest and least popular war in American history. Extensive bombing campaigns occured to try and defeat the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army but was met with limited sucess. Overall, the war proved too costly and unpopular to continue allowing for Vietnam to become Communist.</p>
